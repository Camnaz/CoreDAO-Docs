When you're new to the Core blockchain, here's what you need to know:

2. For first-time users, Core offers a one-time benefit to help you get started:
* If you bridge at least 10 USDT to Core, you qualify for the Core Faucet.
* This Faucet automatically deposits some CORE into your wallet.
3. The process works as follows:
* First, bridge your funds (minimum 10 USDT) to the Core blockchain.
* Upon successful bridging, Core will automatically deposit CORE into your wallet.

After minting stCORE with CORE token, your asset is automatically engaged in Core’s consensus mechanism, entitling you to consensus rewards. stCORE is both liquid and yield-bearing, enabling you to earn rewards while participating in dApps that offer additional benefits for using stCORE tokens. You also earn daily Sparks with stCORE. Get started by visiting https://stake.coredao.org/stcore and minting stCORE.
  

### 6. What’s the incentive and when can I receive them?###  
The incentive is in the form of stCORE token and it will be available for claims inside your Ignition dashboard. Distribution is expected to occur in three phases during Season 2, with each phase roughly two months apart. While Sparks points are an important factor in calculating your rewards, other potential factors may include on-chain activity, value deposited in dApps, ranking, campaign participation, team engagement, and earned badges.

  
### 7. Difference between Core Ignition versus Core Ignition Builder’s incentive program?###  

The Core Ignition incentive program rewards loyal users to foster growth in Core Chain’s BTCfi ecosystem. In contrast, the Core Ignition Builder’s incentive program rewards developers for creating dApps/projects on the Core Chain.

  
### 8. I don’t have any Bitcoin token (BTC). Can I still participate in Core’s BTCfi ecosystem?###  

Absolutely! You can still participate in Core's BTCfi ecosystem even without holding Bitcoin. As an EVM-compatible chain, Core offers a range of DeFi opportunities similar to other EVM chains, including DEXes, lending protocols, perpetual futures, restaking, and NFT platforms. Core's mission is to unlock $1.25T of trapped Bitcoin liquidity, creating opportunities for all web3 users.
