### How to Boost Sparks ###
Sparks are cumulative points reflecting how active you are in Core ecosystem, updated daily at 00:00 UTC and appear on Leaderboard. You earn Sparks daily through:
1. Assets put in Core Ignition wallet balance
2. Activities with Core ecosystem dApps
3. Different campaigns joined
4. Invite new users to join your team

**1. Assets in Ignition Wallet Balance**
The amount and type of whitelisted assets you bridge to Core will be reflected in your Ignition Wallet Balance. By holding these assets on Core, you will earn Sparks. Sparks are calculated daily based on your wallet balance.

**2. Activities with Core Ecosystem dApps**
You could also earn Sparks by interacting with whitelisted dApps on Core Ignition. Each on-chain activity with these dApps will contribute Spark points to your account.

**3. Campaign Joined**
Core Ignition will feature flash or time-limited campaigns on a rolling basis, offering you special opportunities to supercharge your Sparks. Stay connected by checking the in-app campaign sections and following Core's official announcements on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/Coredao_Org) for the latest updates.

**4. Invite New Users**
By inviting new users to Core Ignition, you will receive 10% of the daily Sparks earned by your first-degree invitees and 2% from your second-degree invitees. Please note that a cap may apply to the maximum Sparks you can earn through referrals.
