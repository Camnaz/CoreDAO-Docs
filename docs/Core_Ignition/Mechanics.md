### Ignition Wallet Balance ###
Ignition Wallet balance displays a subset of whitelisted assets you hold on Core. You can earn Sparks (points) by bridging/holding assets with extra Sparks boost on Core.

### Ignition dApp Balance ###
Ignition dApp balance reflects the assets you deposited inside the whitelisted dApps on Core. You can also boost Sparks by interacting with whitelisted dApps on Core.

### How to Boost Sparks ###
Sparks are cumulative points reflecting how active you are in Core ecosystem, updated daily at 00:00 UTC and appear on Leaderboard. You earn Sparks daily through:

**1. Assets in Ignition Wallet Balance:**
The amount and type of whitelisted assets you bridge to Core will be reflected in your Ignition Wallet Balance. By holding these assets on Core, you will earn Sparks. Sparks are calculated daily based on your wallet balance.

**2. Activities with Core Ecosystem dApp:**
You could also earn Sparks by interacting with whitelisted dApps on Core Ignition. Each on-chain activity with these dApps will contribute Spark points to your account. More details will be updated soon.

**3. Campaign Joined:**
Core Ignition will feature flash or time-limited campaigns on a rolling basis, offering you special opportunities to supercharge your Sparks. Stay connected by checking the in-app campaign sections and following Core's official announcements on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/Coredao_Org) for the latest updates.

**4. Invite New Users to Join Ignition:**
If you're new to Core Ignition, bridge $100 USDT worth of whitelisted assets to Core to unlock a permanent invite link. If you signed up in Season 1, your invite code is automatically unlocked. By inviting new users to Core Ignition, you will receive 10% of the daily Sparks earned by your first-degree invitees and 2% from your second-degree invitees. Please note that a cap may apply to the maximum Sparks you can earn through referrals. 


### How to Boost Multipliers ###
Multipliers are dynamic variables to multiply your Spark points. The multiplier displayed on your dashboard reflects the multiplier currently applying to your entire asset. This multiplier is calculated by averaging out the multipliers distributing across your assets.

Below are the baseline multipliers for the whitelisted assets inside your wallet or deposited into various dApps.

| Whitelisted Assets  |Wallet Assets | Lending | Borrowing | Liquidity Provision | 
| ------------- |-------------| ------------- |-------------| ------------- |
| coreBTC, stCORE | 2x | 2.5x | 3x | 3.5x |
| USDT, USDC | 1.5x | 2x | 2.5x | 3x |
| CORE, WCORE, aBTC, wBTC, rBTC solvBTC.b, solvBTC.m, BTCB, BTC.B, wETH | 1x | 1.5x | 2x | 2.5x |

  
>***Example 1:***
>If you hold 10 stCORE in Ignition wallet balance, you get:  
>Daily Sparks = stCORE amount * stCORE price * Multiplier = 10 stCORE * $1.5 (assumed) * 2 = 30  

>***Example 2:***
>If you lend 20 stCORE in a Lending Protocol, you get:  
>Daily Sparks = stCORE amount * stCORE price * Multiplier = 20 stCORE * $1.5(assumed) * 2.5 = 75

In addition to holding strategic tokens and deploying your assets into various dApps, you can also earn additional Multipliers by taking actions from special campaigns. The multipliers from campaigns can stack on top of the baseline multipliers highlighted above to further boost your Sparks earning. Baseline multipliers are subject to change without prior notice.
