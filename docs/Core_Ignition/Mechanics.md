### Ignition Wallet Balance ###
Ignition Wallet balance displays a subset of whitelisted assets you hold on Core. You can boost Sparks by bringing more whitelisted assets on Core.

### Ignition dApp Balance ###
Ignition dApp balance reflects the assets you put in whitelisted dApps on Core. You can also boost Sparks by interacting with whitelisted dApps on Core.

### How to Boost Sparks ###
Sparks are cumulative points reflecting how active you are in Core ecosystem, updated daily at 00:00 UTC and appear on Leaderboard. You earn Sparks daily through:

**1. Assets in Ignition Wallet Balance:**
The amount and type of whitelisted assets you bridge to Core will be reflected in your Ignition Wallet Balance. By holding these assets on Core, you will earn Sparks. Sparks are calculated daily based on your wallet balance.

**2. Activities with Core Ecosystem dApp:s**
You could also earn Sparks by interacting with whitelisted dApps on Core Ignition. Each on-chain activity with these dApps will contribute Spark points to your account. More details will be updated soon.

**3. Campaign Joined:**
Core Ignition will feature flash or time-limited campaigns on a rolling basis, offering you special opportunities to supercharge your Sparks. Stay connected by checking the in-app campaign sections and following Core's official announcements on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/Coredao_Org) for the latest updates.

**4. Invite New Users to Join Ignition:**
If you're new to Core Ignition, bridge $100 USDT in whitelisted assets to Core to unlock a permanent invite link. If you signed up in Season 1, your invite code is automatically unlocked. By inviting new users to Core Ignition, you will receive 10% of the daily Sparks earned by your first-degree invitees and 2% from your second-degree invitees. Please note that a cap may apply to the maximum Sparks you can earn through referrals. 


### How to Boost Multipliers ###
Multipliers are dynamic variables to multiply your Spark points. You can earn Multipliers by taking actions highlighted below and in special campaigns. Multipliers are stackable and may subject to change. The multiplier displayed in dashboard is your average earned.

>Daily Sparks = stCORE amount * stCORE price * Multiplier = 20 stCORE * $1.5(assumed) * 2.5 = 75
