# CORE Delegation Guide
---

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is one of the three fundamental components of the Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism, playing a pivotal role in enhancing the functionality, security, and efficiency of the blockchain network. In the Core network, DPoS is implemented through CORE delegations, allowing CORE holders to delegate their tokens to trusted validators. This process not only helps secure the network but also enables participants to share in the system’s rewards.
In this guide, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to delegate your CORE tokens to validators within the Core network, empowering you to actively contribute to the ecosystem while reaping the benefits of your investment.

### Core Staking Website

- Mainnet: https://stake.coredao.org/
- Testnet: https://stake.test.btcs.network/ 

### Step 1: Navigating to Core Staking Website

When you visit [stake.coredao.org](https://stake.coredao.org/), you’ll see an overview of important metrics related to Core delegation. These metrics provide a snapshot of the staking opportunities available on Core, and are updated in real-time based on the user participation. It also lists Validator information, with all validators ranked by their current hybrid score.

### Step 1.1: Connect Your Wallet

To start staking, follow these steps to connect your wallet. 

>Ensure you have CORE tokens in your wallet to participate in staking.

- Click on the “**Connect Wallet**” button located at the top-right corner of the page.
- Choose your preferred wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect) from the available options.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the connection process securely.
- Once connected, your wallet balance and details will be visible, and you can begin delegating CORE tokens.

### Step 1.2: Choosing a Validator

On the staking site, each validator is ranked by their Hybrid Score, which reflects a combination of factors such as performance and delegated hash power. To maximize your staking rewards, focus on the following two key metrics:

- **CORE Reward Rate**: This shows the percentage of CORE rewards you can earn by delegating to a particular validator. A higher reward rate means more potential returns on your staked CORE.

- **Commission**: This is the fee that validators take from your staking rewards. A lower commission allows you to keep more of your earned rewards, so it's important to choose a validator with a low commission to maximize your returns.

Validator information is refreshed daily at 00:00 UTC at the beginning of each new round, ensuring you always have the latest data when making your staking decisions.

In the example, we are selecting: **DAO Validator 6**

>Click on the Validator Name to Proceed

### Step 2: Delegating CORE to a Validator

Once you’ve selected a validator, you’ll be taken to their detailed page, as shown below. Here’s what you’re seeing:

- **Delegated Coin (CORE)**: The total amount of CORE tokens already delegated to this validator (e.g., **6,678,941 CORE**).
- **CORE Reward Rate**: The annual percentage of rewards for delegating to this validator. In this case, the CORE reward rate is **9.41%**, meaning you’ll earn this percentage in rewards on your staked CORE.
- **Commission**: The validator’s commission fee, which is deducted from your rewards. This validator charges a **5% commission**.
- **Delegators**: The number of users who have delegated to this validator (e.g., **16,234 CORE Delegators**).

To delegate your CORE tokens, follow these steps:

1. **Click "Delegate"**: At the top right of the screen, you’ll see the **Delegate** button (marked as 1 in the image). Hover over it.

2. **Select CORE**: A drop-down will appear with the option to delegate **CORE** or **BTC**. Select **CORE** (marked as 2 in the image).

### Step 2.1 Specify amount of CORE to delegate

After selecting CORE, you’ll be prompted to enter the amount of CORE you want to delegate. Review the validator’s commission, then click **‘Confirm Delegation’**.

Also **confirm the transaction in your Metamask**.

### Step 2.1.1 Confirm the transaction submitted / succeeded

You can see that **1 CORE has been successfully delegated to DAO Validator 6**.

</div>

### Step 2.2 Verifying Delegated CORE

Now that we’ve successfully delegated **CORE**, lets verify that our CORE is now being staked by hovering over our connected wallet in the top right corner, and clicking on the ‘**My Staking**’ dropdown.

We can see under the ‘**Core Delegated**’ column that we now have 1 CORE delegated, or 1 CORE staked:

### Step 3 Undelegating CORE 

If we want to **Undelegate** our **CORE**, you will want to click the 3 dots at the end of your chosen validator, and click: ‘**Undelegate CORE**’.

### Step 3.1 Confirm the transaction, and verify undelegated CORE

After clicking Undelegate, you will be prompted to confirm the transaction in your **Metamask**.

Click the ‘**Confirm**’ button:

If you return to ‘**My Staking**’, you should now see your **CORE Delegated** displaying **0**.

Clicking the ‘**Transaction Records**’ button allows us to view the **Staking Records**, and the delegation events that have occurred under the **CORE Records** tab:

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you have successfully learned how to **delegate** and **undelegate** your **CORE tokens** within the **Core network**. **Delegating CORE tokens allows you to participate in securing the network while earning rewards through a validator's performance**. It’s a simple yet effective way to engage with Core’s decentralized ecosystem and benefit from its Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) mechanism. Whether you're staking or withdrawing your assets, this guide ensures that you can navigate the process confidently, helping you make informed decisions as an active member of the Core community.
