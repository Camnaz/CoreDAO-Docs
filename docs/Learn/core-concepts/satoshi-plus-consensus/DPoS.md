# Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
---

## Overview
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is an open and accessible variation of traditional Proof of Stake used in Satoshi Plus to involve CORE token holders in the election of Core validators alongside Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin stakers. 

DPoS allows holders of Core's native CORE tokens to participate in the network's security by staking their tokens and delegating them to their chosen validators. This process enables all token holders, regardless of the amount they hold, to contribute to the network’s governance and security.

## Step by Step Process

1. **Staking CORE Tokens:** CORE token holders decide to participate in network security by staking their tokens.

2. **Delegating to Validators:** Token holders delegate their staked CORE tokens to a chosen validator, assisting their hybrid score in the validator election process.

3. **Validator Election:** Validators with the highest hybrid score, which includes delegated CORE, are elected to the validator set for a given round.

4. **Producing Blocks:** Elected validators are responsible for producing blocks and validating transactions during their term, thereby earning rewards.

5. **Earning Rewards:** CORE stakers earn rewards from the validators to whom they delegated.

## Benefits

* **Broad Participation:** DPoS enables all CORE token holders to participate in network security, fostering a more inclusive and decentralized ecosystem.

* **Liquid Staked CORE:** CORE tokens can also be liquid staked, enabling stakers to use stCORE tokens in Core’s DeFi ecosystem.

* **Efficient Block Production:** The delegation process allows for an efficient and scalable model, as proven and capable validators are elected to secure the network.

## Conclusion

Delegated Proof of Stake is a powerful mechanism that enhances the Core blockchain's security and efficiency. By allowing CORE token holders to stake and delegate their tokens, DPoS promotes broad participation and robust network security.
