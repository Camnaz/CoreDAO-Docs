# Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking
---

Over [1 trillion dollars'](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) worth of Bitcoin has remained idle, yielding no native yield for over its lifetime. Since Bitcoin is a Proof of Work blockchain, its holders do not get the yield benefits native to Proof of Stake chains. Nevertheless, Core has delivered Proof of Stake benefits to the definitive Proof of Work blockchain. Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking substantially adds to Core’s security model while also unlocking Bitcoin-native yield for the first time in history. This innovative approach allows Bitcoin holders to participate in and earn from Satoshi Plus without giving up custody of their Bitcoin, thereby integrating Bitcoin's economic power with Core's advanced blockchain functionalities.

## Overview

Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking enables Bitcoin holders to earn CORE tokens by simply locking up their Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain, thereby never giving up custody of their private keys to any third party, external smart contract, or MPC wallet. In locking up their Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin stakers contribute to the election of Core validators, thereby enhancing and decentralizing the security of Satoshi Plus. 

## Step by Step Process

1. **Locking Bitcoin:** Bitcoin holders initiate the staking process by locking their Bitcoin in an absolute time lock on the Bitcoin blockchain.

2. **Including Delegation Information:** Within the locking transaction, stakers include:

3. **Core Validator Address:** The address of the Core Validator to delegate their Bitcoin to.

4. **CORE Token Reward Address:** The address where they want their CORE token rewards sent.

5. **Delegating Bitcoin:** This action delegates the staker’s Bitcoin to the chosen Core validator for a specified period, during which the Bitcoin cannot be spent.

6. **Validator Election:** Core uses the delegated Bitcoin to help elect validators. Validators with higher delegated Bitcoin have a better chance of being elected to the validator set.

7. **Earning Rewards:** Bitcoin stakers earn CORE token rewards for the duration of the lock period, based on the validator's performance and the amount of Bitcoin staked.

8. **Unlocking Bitcoin:** After the lock period ends, the staker’s Bitcoin is unlocked and can be spent again.

## Benefits

* **The Bitcoin Risk-Free Rate:** By introducing zero new trust assumptions, Core’s Bitcoin staking unlocks riskless yield for Bitcoin holders. 

* **Bitcoin-Nativity:** By using Bitcoin’s native absolute time locks, Bitcoin stakers retain full custody of their Bitcoin.

* **Yield Generation:** This mechanism transforms Bitcoin into a yield-bearing asset, providing stakers with CORE token rewards and enhancing the utility of their holdings.

* **Network Integration:** Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking integrates Bitcoin holders into Core’s consensus mechanism, contributing to the network’s security and decentralization.

## Conclusion

Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking transforms the Bitcoin asset from a passive Store of Value into an active, yield-bearing, and security-providing asset. Bitcoin staking allows Bitcoin holders to earn the Bitcoin Risk-Free Rate while also contributing to the security of a smart contract platform designed to unlock more Bitcoin asset use-cases.
